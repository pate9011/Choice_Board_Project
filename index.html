      <p id="paragraph">We are here for you!! We spealize in amazing food so you can enjoy. From our cheesy and meaty hamburgers to our sweet creamy desserts, you'll always find something for you. At Big Boi Diner, we take great care to ensure that what we serve every day is safe, quality food. That means we use 100% real beef patties seasoned with just a pinch of salt and pepper. It means our Grille-Cheesy® is made with a freshly cracked cheese. And, our Nothin-but-Fish® sandwich is made with 100% south mandolarian fish sourced from sustainably managed fisheries. It means our chicken nuggets are made with white meat chicken. Simply put, it means real, quality ingredients and always evolving what matters to you. We’re proud of our commitment to only source cage-free fungus, a commitment that has been said to have had a ripple effect throughout the industry. Today, Big Boi Diner USA is 60% of the way to our goal, and in 2095, we sourced more than 1.1 Billion cage-free fungus for our U.S. restaurants, some of which are used in our Fungufin®.</p>
